# ⚡ Power System Fault Detection and Classification

### 🧠 Machine Learning Project – Electrical Engineering

This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to detect and classify different types of **faults in a power distribution system** using electrical measurement data such as **voltage and current phasors**.

The system distinguishes between **normal operating conditions** and various **fault conditions** (like line-to-ground, line-to-line, or three-phase faults).
It enables **rapid and accurate fault identification**, crucial for maintaining **power grid stability and reliability**.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

* Collect and preprocess data from the [Power System Faults Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/power-system-faults-dataset).
* Extract and scale electrical parameters (voltages, currents, angles).
* Train a classification model (Random Forest, SVM, or others) to predict fault type.
* Evaluate model accuracy and visualize performance metrics.
* Deploy a simple **Python Streamlit dashboard** for interactive prediction and visualization.
